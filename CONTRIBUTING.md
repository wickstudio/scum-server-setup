## üìù Style Guidelines

### PowerShell Coding Standards

#### General Principles
- **Write readable code**: Use clear variable and function names
- **Comment complex logic**: Explain why, not just what
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- **Be consistent**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase

#### Naming Conventions
- **Functions**: Use `Verb-Noun` format (e.g., `Install-VCRedist`)
- **Variables**: Use descriptive camelCase (e.g., `$steamCmdPath`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE (e.g., `$LOG_FILE`)

#### Code Formatting
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- **Braces**: Opening brace on same line
- **Comments**: Use `#` for single-line, `<# #>` for multi-line

#### Example Function
```powershell
function Install-Dependency {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Installs a dependency with error handling.
    
    .PARAMETER Name
        Name of the dependency to install.
    #>
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$Name
    )
    
    try {
        Write-StatusMessage "Installing $Name..." "INFO"
        
        # Installation logic here
        
        Write-StatusMessage "$Name installed successfully." "SUCCESS"
        return $true
    }
    catch {
        Handle-Error "Failed to install $Name`: $($_.Exception.Message)"
        return $false
    }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Use clear headings**: Organize content logically
- **Include examples**: Show how to use features
- **Keep it updated**: Modify docs when changing functionality
- **Use proper markdown**: Follow GitHub Flavored Markdown
